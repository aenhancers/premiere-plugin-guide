Transmitters
################################################################################

Starting in CS6, the Transmit API is the preferred mean

This new API provides support for pushing video, audio, and closed captions to external hardware. Transmitters can be specified by the user in Preferences > Playback. Other plug-ins such as importers and effects with settings preview dialogs can send video out to the active transmit- ter, opening up new possibilities for hardware monitoring. Transmit plug-ins are supported in Premiere Pro, After Effects (starting in CC 2014), SpeedGrade, Encore, and Prelude (note that since Prelude CS6 Windows is a 32-bit application, it uses 32-bit transmitter plug-ins).

When a new transmitter instance is created, it is asked to describe the format(s) it wishes to re- ceive the rendered video in. A transmitter plug-in can request different formats depending on the source clip or timeline format. The host application will handle all the conversions to the desired video format. As an example, a transmitter instance may specify that it can only handle a fixed width and height, but any pixel format. Besides video conversions, the host handles scheduling for prefetching the media and asynchronous rendering.

A transmitter may leave the audio to be played by the host, through the system's sound drivers (ASIO or CoreAudio). Or, if a transmitter wants to handle the audio itself to send it to the exter- nal hardware, it can request audio using GetNextAudioBuffer in the Playmod Audio Suite.

On playback, the host provides the transmitter with a clock callback, which the transmitter must call to update the host with the new time every frame. This allows the transmitter to orchestrate the audio/video sync.

Transmitters can use the Captioning Suite to get any closed captions for the sequence.

Transmitters do not need to call the Playmod Device Controller suite to handle Export to Tape. This is handled at the player level.

What's New in Premiere Pro CS6.0.2?
================================================================================

A transmitter can now provide strings to label its audio channels, in tmAudioMode.outOutÂ­ putAudioNames. These strings will be used for the Audio Output Mapping preferences, rather than the default strings.
