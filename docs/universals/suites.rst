Suites
################################################################################

There are different sets of function suites available to Premiere plug-ins. The SweetPea Suites are the more modern suites that have been added for most new functionality. The piSuites are still needed for various functionality that has not all been superceded by the SweetPea Suites. Whenever possible, use the SweetPea Suites.

There are also function suites more specific to certain plug-in types. The Bottleneck Functions are useful for transitions and video filters. Other suites available to only one plug-in type are documented in the appropriate chapter for that plug-in type.
