Getting Support and Providing Feedback
################################################################################

Please read relevant sections of this document and view the included sample code before requesting assistance. Please direct questions regarding installation, configuration, or use of Adobe products to Adobe Technical Support.

Having a solid understanding of digital video concepts is vital to developing plug-ins. This documentation assumes you understand basic video topics such as resolution, frame rates, field interlacing, pixel aspect ratio, bit depth, timecode, compression, color spaces, etc. You must also understand how your plug-in will fit into a user's workflow in Premiere Pro. If you aren't yet familiar with Premiere Pro or video editing concepts, we recommend the Adobe Premiere Pro Classroom in a Book.

To report a bug or submit a feature request for Premiere Pro, please visit: http://www.adobe.com/products/wishform.html

Since this form can be used to submit bugs and features for all Adobe products, make sure you have the right product selected.

We encourage you to use the Premiere Pro SDK forum to ask questions on the API and general integration. For development questions that you'd rather keep confidential, you may contact API Engineering directly. Your feedback can improve the API and SDK to streamline future development.
